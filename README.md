# LabView Projects

Welcome to the LabView Projects repository! Here you will find a collection of LabView projects, each designed to help you learn and master different aspects of LabView programming.

## Lab 1: AC/DC Circuits and Basic Measurements

In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with AC/DC circuits and learn the basics of making measurements using LabView. You will learn how to set up your measurement hardware and create a LabView program to acquire and analyze data.

## Lab 2: AC Transformers

Explore the world of AC transformers and learn how to model and analyze them using LabView. This lab will guide you through the process of setting up transformer models, running simulations, and analyzing the results.

## Lab 3: Permanent Magnet Brushed DC Motor

Dive into the operation and control of Permanent Magnet Brushed DC Motors using LabView. Learn how to implement control algorithms, acquire motor performance data, and optimize motor operation.

## Lab 4: AC Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor

Understand the workings of an AC Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor and learn to control and analyze its performance using LabView. This lab covers advanced topics and provides a comprehensive learning experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with these labs, you will need to have LabView installed on your computer. You can download LabView from the [official National Instruments website](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html).
